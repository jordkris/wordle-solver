As used in businesses, high schools and universities in 30 countries, such as American University and Johns Hopkins University.

Discover a new graphical way to understand accounting.

HOW THIS BOOK IS DIFFERENT AND DELIVERS RESULTS

The Joy of Accounting uses a revolutionary system of teaching that’s getting rave reviews at top universities, banks, law firms and business schools.

This is what Harvard Business School had to say:
""[The system] has the advantage of showing how accounting works visually. We all tend to see problems and relationships more easily visually, so the [Joy of Accounting] approach takes advantage of how we learn most effectively. As such, I believe that it is of value to anyone who is interested in understanding how accounting works (from high school students to undergrads to MBAs to business executives)."" - Paul Healy, Professor of Business Administration, Harvard Business School

Other books teach the fundamentals of finance and accounting using jargon and vague language. They don’t use graphics and skip over concepts they assume you know.
What makes The Joy of Accounting truly different to other accounting books is a diagram which shows accounting on a single page. Using color-coding, the game-changing Color Accounting BaSIS Framework makes accounting as easy as pointing a finger.

Accounting made easy:
By observing thousands of learners in cities around the world, from New York, London and LA to Sydney and 30 countries, the authors identified 3 aspects of learning that, when addressed guarantee you’ll “get” accounting.

Hands-on and visual learning:
The book is fun and rigorous at the same time. With available props for purchase, the process is like an accounting game and simple to follow.

Is it truly revolutionary?
Yes, the Color Accounting BaSIS Framework™ does for accounting what the mouse and icons did for computers. When Apple introduced the Macintosh, using a computer became as simple as pointing, and everyone could do it.

The Joy of Accounting means that ANYONE can now see how accounting works.

In this book, you will find:
•A simple step-by-step sequence to follow
•Over 150 full-color diagrams
•Explanations of business concepts such as working capital, cash flow, liquidity, leverage, receivables and depreciation.
•Traditional terms explained, like ledgers, journals, debits and credits.
•US and International accounting standards
•Case studies

BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH
•Confidently read balance sheets and income statements
•Take control of your profitability, cash flow and growth
•Budget effectively
•Talk about financial matters powerfully
•Revisit previous accounting studies for deeper understanding

THE AUTHORS
Peter Frampton and Mark Robilliard:
•Taught tens of thousands of people in businesses and universities
•Teach acclaimed university courses
•Speak at industry associations such as the Society for Human Resource Management, the Association for Talent Development, and the Project Management Institute.

WHO IS THIS BOOK FOR?
•Managers wanting to take control of their business
•High school, home school and university students

In this book, Brian Tracy walks you through the hidden secrets of what makes self-made millionaires, and shows how anyone, no matter where they are in life at this moment, can become a millionaire.
 
The advice in this book is based on Brian Tracy's twenty-five years of research, teaching, and personal experience on the subject of self-made millionaires. Tracy himself used these ideas to rise from humble beginnings to become a millionaire. And Tracy has discovered that all successful people practice these 21 success secrets, whether they're consciously aware of it or not. In The 21 Success Secrets of Self-Made Millionaires Tracy not only identifies and defines each success secret, but also reveals its source and foundation, illustrates how it functions in the world, and shows how to apply it in life and work through specific steps and practical exercises that everyone can use.
 
Easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to apply, this book shows how anyone can cultivate the habits and behaviors that will enable them to achieve not just financial independence, but success in any area of life. Because, as Tracy writes, ""The most important part of achieving great success is not the money. It is the kind of person you have to become to earn that money and hold onto it.""",

Every day there are traders who make a fortune. It may seem that it seldom happens, but it does - as William Eckhardt, Ed Seykota, Jim Simons, and many others remind us. You can join them by using systems to manage your trading.


This book explains exactly how you can build a winning trading system. It is an insight into what a trader should know and do in order to achieve success in the markets, and it will show you why you don't need to be a rocket scientist to build a winning trading system.


There are three main parts to Trading Systems. Part One is a short, practical guide to trading systems' development and evaluation. It condenses the authors' years of experience into a number of practical tips. It also forms the theoretical basis for Part Two, in which readers will find a step-by-step development process for building a trading system, covering everything from initial code writing to walk forward analysis and money management. Part Three shows you how to combine a number of trading systems, for all the different markets, into an effective portfolio of systems.


A trader can never really say he was successful, but only that he survived to trade another day; the ""black swan"" is always just around the corner. Trading Systems will help you find your way through the uncharted waters of systematic trading and show you what it takes to be among those that survive. A new approach to system development.",

Workers today are becoming more sedentary. We are thinking more and using our bodies less - we communicate all day with a computer screen, becoming so absorbed that our shoulders tense, our breathing changes, we hold our breath too much and, by the end of the day, we're exhausted.

Extensive research has linked dysfunctional breathing patterns to problems such as occupational overuse and RSI. The main risks are: 
* asymmetry in body activity, eg use of mouse in one hand
* use of upper shoulder muscles in typing and turning at the same time
* breath holding or very shallow breathing during movements
* lack of awareness of breath holding
* lack of awareness of body bracing

The exercises in this book will help you restore energy-efficient breathing and improve your energy levels, productivity and work pace. You will learn to run on natural not nervous energy, and your thought patterns will become calm but alert. You will reduce your stress levels naturally and without drugs.

The book includes a number of crucial exercises specifically for high computer users, and more general exercises for all sedentary workers. Then there are exercises to energise you and to reduce anxiety before presentations, meetings and job interviews.

Authors Dinah Bradley and Tania Clifton-Smith — the 'queens of calm '— are world experts on breathing pattern disorders. As practising physiotherapists they have an in-depth understanding of the physiological and musculoskeletal problems caused by poor breathing.",

I’ve made all the photography mistakes there are to make, and more. Combine that with no formal training in photography and you could say I started out late to the race.

It took me years of trial and error to discover real-world solutions to my technical roadblocks, but like learning the scales on the guitar is necessary before you can begin phrasing, once I did I was on my way to consistently getting better images. And by learning these simple solutions you can too.

In this book you’re going to learn how to avoid common technical roadblocks, because I really believe that if you can move past the technical aspects of photography you can focus your precious time and energy on that which pays the highest dividends: seeing creatively and executing your vision onto film or pixels.

Although I have no formal training in photography I did learn a great deal (and I believe you can, too) from at least two photographers who I’ll mention here: Ansel Adams and Galen Rowell. Sure, their photographic work is seminal, however they also left in their wake another legacy: their thoughts and writings on photography, which have influenced me and therefore what’s in this book directly.

I have to give a huge thanks to all of the members of the photography community I began in San Francisco which now has over 1,000 members - Landscape Photography SF. Through this community I have shared and learned a great deal, and only through the process of constant feedback is this book even possible.",

This one can.

The Cash Machine is unlike any other personal finance book ever written. Not only will you get sucked into the rollercoaster relationship of Amber and Dylan, but you’ll learn hundreds of money lessons along the way, giving you the tools to drive your financial destiny.

As the book begins, Amber thinks her finances are under control, but her worldview crumbles when she encounters her college flame, Dylan, and his unusual perspective on money. While Amber and her friends were finishing their degrees, Dylan dropped out to pursue a different goal: Financial Independence.

Amber doesn’t even know what Financial Independence means when she reconnects with Dylan seven years later. What she does know is that there’s nothing exciting about his lifestyle. At first she writes him off as a bum, but the more she questions, the more she realizes that how calculated his financial choices are. He’s not struggling for money; he’s building a Cash Machine.

Amber wants to give Dylan another chance, but realizes she can never build a life with him until she understands his financial path. So she asks Dylan to teach her how to build a Cash Machine of her own.

Unlike other personal finance books, that are normally written by finance experts and that only cover the areas of their expertise, The Cash Machine was not written by financial experts. Just the opposite. Before starting The Cash Machine, Dave and Chana Mason found themselves deeply in debt, despite having earned significant amounts of money in their careers. They came to realize that what they didn’t understand about money really was hurting them, and that the time had come to get themselves a strong financial education. And when Dave and Chana want to grow in some area, they find that there’s no better way than to research and write a novel on the subject.

The result is a novel that has more financial lessons than any personal finance book they’ve ever seen, all taught through a story to make the lessons really stick. The lessons taught inside include:

Credit Card Hacks. How to turn the high interest credit card arena in your favor
Stock Market Strategies: How to get the highest returns from the market without getting your savings eaten up in fees
Real Estate: Bring your housing costs down to zero and use real estate to generate equity and passive income
Tax Shelters: Build your wealth faster by earning and growing it tax free
Transportation: The fastest area to gain financial traction

Discover hundreds of financial lessons, seamlessly taught within a novel you won’t want to put down.

The Cash Machine isn’t just another money book. This page-turning love story teaches hundreds of financial lessons, giving you the tools to drive your financial destiny.",

To him comes Virgil, the symbol of philosophy, to guide him through the two lower realms of the next world, which are divided according to the classifications of the ‘Ethics’ of Aristotle. Hell is seen as an inverted cone with its point where lies Lucifer fixed in ice at the centre of the world, and the pilgrimage from it is a climb to the foot of and then up the Purgatorial Mountain. Along the way Dante passes Popes, Kings and Emperors, poets, warriors and citizens of Florence, expiating the sins of their life on earth. On the summit is the Earthly Paradise where Beatrice meets them and Virgil departs. Dante is now led through the various spheres of heaven, and the poem ends with a vision of the Deity.

What Readers are Saying about the author's previous Nikon guides:


This is the most helpful manual I've ever used. No serious Nikon user should be without this. I find myself referring back to this book quite often - very easy to find what I need and even easier to understand.

-S.B.



All I Need - I have been using Nikon dSLR cameras for many years. In all this time I have never come across a publication which complements the rather soulless and complex user manual so well. Your excellent work is all I need to exploit the potential of this amazing dSLR.

-Martin D.


A well written, professional helpful guide - Exciting, clear to follow, has examples and is by a professional who gives just the right amount of technical info with explanations of why and when to use those settings, all properly explained. The book is well thought through and well written.

The ready acceptance of Chekhov has been one of the few successful features of this irresponsible output. He has been welcomed by British critics with something like affection. Bernard Shaw has several times remarked: “Every time I see a play by Chekhov, I want to chuck all my own stuff into the fire.” Others, having no such valuable property to sacrifice on the altar of Chekhov, have not hesitated to place him side by side with Ibsen, and the other established institutions of the new theatre. For these reasons it is pleasant to be able to chronicle the fact that, by way of contrast with the casual treatment normally handed out to Russian authors, the publishers are issuing the complete dramatic works of this author. In 1912 they brought out a volume containing four Chekhov plays, translated by Marian Fell. All the dramatic works not included in her volume are to be found in the present one.",

Many of the works on Buchanan’s extensive list of publications stemmed from a single insight from early in his career: because neither the state nor society is a singular and sentient creature, a great deal of analytical and policy confusion is spawned by treating them as such. Collections of individuals cannot be fused or aggregated together into a super-individual about whom economists and political philosophers can usefully theorize in the same ways that they theorize about actual flesh-and-blood individuals.

Aggregative thinking lumps together a great many individuals into large categories such as “the nation” or “the government” and then treats each of these categories as if it is a unitary thinking, choosing, and acting individual. Under this approach, “the social welfare” is promoted by “the government,” with the latter treated as if it’s an organism possessing a brain, and as if that brain’s main interest lies not in serving itself but, rather, in serving the nation. Overlooked are the processes—all churning with assorted incentives and constraints—that lead individuals with diverse interests to undertake actions such as forming governments, becoming government officials, and dealing with government both as citizens who receive benefits from it and who incur costs to sustain it and to affect its activities.

From the very start, nearly all of Buchanan’s lifetime work was devoted to replacing this approach with the individualistic one—a way of doing economics and political science that insists that choices are made, and costs and benefits are experienced, only by individuals. 

Buchanan believed deeply that each individual is morally equal to every other individual. Because no person is superior, ethically speaking, to any other person, no person’s opinions or preferences should be given special advantage over those of other persons. He believed that this conclusion holds fast despite the undeniable fact that some individuals are smarter, or better educated, or wealthier, or higher-born than others.

James Buchanan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1986, and formally retired from the faculty of George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, in 1999, though he continued to conduct seminars for graduate students for several years afterward. And he continued to be a regular presence on campus until the very end. He died in Blacksburg, Virginia, after a brief illness, on January 9th, 2013, at the age of 93.",

After an interval of two years Browning published, this time under his own name, a second long poem. The subject, Paracelsus, had been suggested by the friend, Amédeé de Ripert-Monclar, to whom the poem is dedicated. In pursuance of his purposed rehabilitation of a vanished age Browning made extensive researches in the British Museum into the history of Paracelsus, the great leader in sixteenth century medical science; but in the poem the facts are subordinated to a minute analysis of the spiritual history of Paracelsus. The poem was too abstruse in subject and style to bring Browning popularity, but his genius was recognized by important critics.",

Unknown Market Wizards continues in the three-decade tradition of the hugely popular Market Wizards series, interviewing exceptionally successful traders to learn how they achieved their extraordinary performance results. 


The twist in Unknown Market Wizards is that the featured traders are individuals trading their own accounts. They are unknown to the investment world. Despite their anonymity, these traders have achieved performance records that rival, if not surpass, the best professional managers. 


Some of the stories include: 


- A trader who turned an initial account of $2,500 into $50 million.

- A trader who achieved an average annual return of 337% over a 13-year period.

- A trader who made tens of millions using a unique approach that employed neither fundamental nor technical analysis.

- A former advertising executive who used classical chart analysis to achieve a 58% average annual return over a 27-year trading span.

- A promising junior tennis player in the UK who abandoned his quest for a professional sporting career for trading and generated a nine-year track record with an average annual return just under 300%.


World-renowned author and trading expert Jack D. Schwager is our guide. His trademark knowledgeable and sensitive interview style encourages the Wizards to reveal the fascinating details of their training, experience, tactics, strategies, and their best and worst trades. There are dashes of humour and revelations about the human side of trading throughout.


The result is an engrossing new collection of trading wisdom, brimming with insights that can help all traders improve their outcomes.",

Against all the odds, Australia held a royal commission into the banking and financial services industries. Its revelations rocked the nation. Even defenders of the banks were blindsided. 

Few people were more instrumental in bringing about the commission than journalist Adele Ferguson. Through her exposes in print and on television, she pursued the truth about funds mismanagement, fraud, lack of probity, and the hard-sell culture that took over the finance industry after deregulation in the 1980s. But it wasn't just light-touch regulators and crooked bankers growing fat on bonuses she put under the spotlight. It was also their victims - men and women who had lost everything, and had no recourse when they discovered empty accounts, egregious fees, forged documents and broken promises.

Now in Banking Bad, Ferguson tells the full story of the power imbalance, toxic culture and cover-ups. She describes the long fight for justice by whistleblowers, victims and political mavericks, and she looks at the outcomes of the royal commission - the falls from grace, the damaging hubris, the scathing assessment of the regulators, and the colossal compensation bill - an estimated $10 billion.

Finally, she asks whereto from here? In May 2019, the Coalition government, which resisted calls for a royal commission, was re-elected. Bank stocks surged and lending regulations were loosened. Will it all be business as usual from now on, or have our financial executives learned that their wealth cannot come at the expense of ordinary Australians?

This is a book for every person with a bank account.

PRAISE

'If you want a glimpse of the reality distortion that multi-millionaire bankers live in, you need to read Banking Bad.' - Scott Pape

'Ferguson's pacey writing style gives the book the air of a corporate thriller.' - Michael Rowland, ABC News Breakfast

'And for those of who anticipate that corporate Australia will lapse back into the state of complacency and misconduct revealed in the APRA CBA Report and the Hayne Royal Commission, ... should read the whole book for themselves - for no other reason than that it so clearly identifies the issues of governance and culture that seems to have escaped them for so long.' - Graeme Samuel, Professorial Fellow in the Monash Business School and former chairman of the ACCC

'One of the best prose translations of Euripides I have seen'  Robert Fagles

This selection of plays shows Euripides transforming the titanic figures of Greek myths into recognizable, fallible human beings. Medea, in which a spurned woman takes revenge upon her lover by killing her children, is one of the most shocking of all the Greek tragedies. Medea is a towering figure who demonstrates Euripides' unusual willingness to give voice to a woman's case. Alcestis is based on a magical myth in which Death is overcome, and The Children of Heracles examines conflict between might and right, while Hippolytus deals with self-destructive integrity.

So when in time a son was born the infant's feet were riveted together and he was left to die on Mount Cithaeron. But a shepherd found the babe and tended him, and delivered him to another shepherd who took him to his master, the King of Corinth. Polybus being childless adopted the boy, who grew up believing that he was indeed the King's son. Afterwards doubting his parentage he inquired of the Delphic god and heard himself the word declared before to Laius. Wherefore he fled from what he deemed his father's house and in his flight he encountered and unwillingly slew his father Laius. Arriving at Thebes he answered the riddle of the Sphinx and the grateful Thebans made their deliverer king. So he reigned in the room of Laius, and espoused the widowed queen. Children were born to them and Thebes prospered under his rule, but again a grievous plague fell upon the city. Again the oracle was consulted and it bade them purge themselves of blood-guiltiness. Oedipus denounces the crime of which he is unaware, and undertakes to track out the criminal. Step by step it is brought home to him that he is the man. The closing scene reveals Jocasta slain by her own hand and Oedipus blinded by his own act and praying for death or exile.",
